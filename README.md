# Auto Align

A blender add-on that automatically aligns objects parallel to the world axis.


## Description

The figure below briefly shows how this add-on works. 

The axis represents the local axis of the model (Dual-clutch gearbox HD by [Artec 3D](https://www.artec3d.com/3d-models/dual-clutch-gearbox-hd)).

There are three options available in the `3D Viewport > Sidebar > Item > Auto Align`.

* `Rotate` : Rotate the selected object to match the world axis.
* `Rotate & Bake` : Same as `Rotate`, but rotation is applied.
* `Keep Position & Bake` : Keep the object fixed and only change the local axis.
